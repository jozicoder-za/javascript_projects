## Sum of Fibonacci Numbers

Given a positive integer num, return the sum of all Fibonacci numbers that are less than equal to num

The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of two previous numbers

The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence ar 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8

For example, sumFibs(10) should return 10 because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal 10 are 1, 1, 3, and 8

**_ Example _**

- `sumOddFibonacciNum(10) should return 10`
- `sumOddFibonacciNum(1000) should return 1785`
- `sumOddFibonacciNum(40000000) should return 4613732`
