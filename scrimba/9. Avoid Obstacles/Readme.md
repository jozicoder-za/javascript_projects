## Avoid Obstacles

You are given an array of integer representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line.

Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate O to the result. You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer

find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.

**_ Example _**

for `inputArray = [5, 3, 6, 7, 9]`, the output should be avoidedObstacles(inputArray) = 4

**_ Hints _**

- `sort()`
- `every()`
